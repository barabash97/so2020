Description: Add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the adduser and deluser commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
   existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from a given
   group.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and the GECOS field.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 Adduser is maintained on http://alioth.debian.org/projects/adduser/.
 There is also a development mailing list on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/adduser-devel/.

Description: Partition editor for Amiga partitions (cross version)
 Amiga-fdisk is, similar to fdisk for PCs, a program to partition
 harddisks. Though it seems to work quite well, it's still got some
 sort of beta status. It's suggested that you still use the AmigaDOS
 native tool "HDToolBox" to partition your harddisks and use
 amiga-fdisk only for querying partition information.

Description: next generation, scalable, extendable web server
 Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server. This
 version - a total rewrite - introduces many new improvements, such as
 threading, a new API, IPv6 support, request/response filtering, and more.
 .
 It is also considerably faster, and can be easily extended to provide services
 other than http.
 .
 This package contains all the standard apache2 modules, including SSL support.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to
 install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages; such as worker or prefork.

Description: GNU Aspell spell-checker
 GNU Aspell is a spell-checker which can be used either as a standalone
 application or embedded in other programs.  Its main feature is that it
 does a much better job of suggesting possible spellings than just about
 any other spell-checker available for the English language, including
 Ispell and Microsoft Word.  It also has many other technical
 enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries
 and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one
 Aspell process is open at once.
 .
 Aspell is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Ispell.
 .
 This is a meta-package for installing the GNU Aspell standalone
 utilities along with an Aspell dictionary.

Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM)
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation.  The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs
 when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when
 you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery).
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM
 events; and apm(1), a client that prints the information in /proc/apm
 in a readable format.
 .
 apmd is notified of APM events by the APM driver in the kernel.
 .
 Debian kernels are built with APM support but it is disabled by
 default.  You need to boot the kernel with the "apm=on" option if you
 want to enable the driver. (You may need to add this option to your
 lilo command line.)

Description: Utilities for using ACPI power management
 Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
 to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and
 configuration status.
 .
 ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering
 ACPI events. It listens on a file (/proc/acpi/event) and when an event
 occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The programs it executes
 are configured through a set of configuration files, which can be
 dropped into place by packages or by the admin.
 .
 In order to use this package you need a recent Kernel (=>2.4.7). This can be
 one including the patches on http://acpid.sourceforge.net or a non patched one.

Description: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

Description: GNU a2ps - 'Anything to PostScript' converter and pretty-printer
 GNU a2ps converts files into PostScript for printing or viewing. It uses a
 nice default format, usually two pages on each physical page, borders
 surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing
 date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, symbol substitution
 as well as pretty printing for a wide range of programming languages.
 .
 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,
  - and various spoken languages.

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.7 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4 and 1.5 did, so has been renamed so that the previous version can
 continue to be made available.

Description: create a skeleton source package for a new program
 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a
 new program which follows the GNU programming standards.  The new
 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the
 Makefile.  `make distcheck' succeeds.
 .
 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a
 new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory
 and populate it with standard files, customized for the new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org> (see
 http://autogen.sourceforge.net/).

Description: Simple text-based mixer control program
 aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
 card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
 line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it
 can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
 boot.
 .
 A wrapper script xaumix is provided that finds and invokes xterm or a
 replacement. This is primarily for creating the best sized terminal window.
 If you want a true graphical interface, install aumix-gtk instead. That has
 the same functionality as this one in addition to offering a nice X GUI.
 .
 The old companion package aumix-alsa, which did take advantage of the
 extra facilities in the ALSA sound driver, is no longer available.
 This package should work fine with the OSS compatibility layer of the
 modern ALSA drivers.

 AppConfig supports a relaxed configuration file syntax with support
 for flags (booleans), single and multivalue (lists or hashes)
 items.  A defined default and validation routine or regex can be
 defined for each option.
 .
 Environment variable, file variable and tilde (~) are supported and
 may be applied to selected configuration options.  For long blocks of
 text you can also use Perl HEREDOC syntax.  Additionally there is
 also a mechanism to utilise all these same features via a CGI.

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software,generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.
 .
 On some architectures, multiple binary packages are provided to take
 advantage of certain commonly available processor instruction set
 extensions.  The instruction extension set used is indicated in the
 package name, with 'base' denoting no extensions. In general, you
 will obtain the best performance by installing the package with the
 most advanced instruction extension set your machine is capable of
 running.

Description: A language tool for constructing recognizers, compilers etc
 ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is
 a language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
 compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing C++
 or Java actions [You can use PCCTS 1.xx to generate C-based parsers].
 .
 Computer language translation has become a common task. While
 compilers and tools for traditional computer languages (such as C
 or Java) are still being built, their number is dwarfed by the thousands
 of mini-languages for which recognizers and translators are being
 developed. Programmers construct translators for database formats,
 graphical data files (e.g., PostScript, AutoCAD), text processing
 files (e.g., HTML, SGML).  ANTLR is designed to handle all of your
 translation tasks.

 Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. The
 automount daemons automatically mount filesystems when they
 are used and unmount them after a period of inactivity. This
 is done based on a set of pre-configured maps.
 .
 The kernel automounter implements an almost complete SunOS
 style automounter under Linux. Automounter version 4
 (autofs4) has to be enabled when compiling the kernel.
 Debian packaged kernels have it enabled.

Description: PCM player designed for ALSA
 Alsaplayer is a PCM player designed specifically for use with ALSA, but
 works great with OSS or EsounD.  It's heavily threaded which cuts down on
 skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
 mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.

 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.

Description: 3D Tron-like high speed game
 The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can only
 turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped) and have
 to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to get your
 opponent to run into them.
 .
 The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever
 wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this
 is your chance.  Of all the Tron clones out there, I think one is the one that
 comes closest to the feeling the movie tries to express.  This is in part
 thanks to the sophisticated camera motions, in part to the superb modelling
 work and in part to the fabulous sound effects.  To add some extra fascination
 into the game, unlike to other Tron clones, in armagetron you can accelerate.
 Alas, there's no accelerate button.  If you want to drive fast, you have to
 drive good -- and really really close to the walls.
 .
 Armagetron can be played against AI opponents, against other humans over the
 network, or a mixture of both.

 directly on top of the alsamixer source, leaving the original source
 intact, only adding a couple of ifdefs, and some calls to the gui
 part, so it provides exactly the same functionality, but with a
 graphical userinterface.

Description: An integrated environment for writing TeX/LaTeX documents
 AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for writing
 input files for TeX/LaTeX using GNU Emacs.
 .
 AUCTeX lets you run TeX/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools, such as a output
 filters or post processor from inside Emacs.  Especially `running LaTeX' is
 interesting, as AUCTeX lets you browse through the errors TeX reported, while
 it moves the cursor directly to the reported error, and displays some
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when the
 document is spread over several files.
 .
 AUCTeX automatically indents your `LaTeX-source', not only as you write it --
 you can also let it indent and format an entire document.  It has a special
 outline feature, which can greatly help you `getting an overview' of a
 document.
 .
 Apart from these special features, AUCTeX provides a large range of handy
 Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write your LaTeX
 documents fast and painlessly.
 .
 All features of AUCTeX are documented using the GNU Emacs online
 documentation system.  That is, documentation for any command is just a
 key click away!
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, and hence you can easily add
 new features for your own needs.  It was not made as part of any
 particular employment or project (apart from the AUCTeX project itself).
 AUCTeX is distributed under the `GNU Emacs General Public License' and
 may therefore almost freely be copied and redistributed.
 .
 Currently XEmacs ships with its own AUCTeX, so this package should only
 be used with GNU/Emacs.  (I.e., you don't need to install this package if
 your site uses only XEmacs.)

Description: ALSA wrapper for OSS applications
 This package contains a program loader, aoss, which wraps
 applications written for OSS in a compatibility library,
 thus allowing them to work with ALSA.
 .
 There are two ways of getting an application to work with
 ALSA if the application was written for OSS. The first way
 is to load the special ALSA drivers that emulate the OSS
 kernel interface; these allow the application to open
 /dev/dsp0 and other OSS device files. The second way is
 to wrap the application in the libaoss library provided
 in this package; the wrapper causes the application to
 access native ALSA device files such as /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c
 instead of OSS device files.
 .
 Use of the alsa-oss library is recommended over the use of
 OSS-emulation drivers if you want to use ALSA's PCM plugin
 layer.
 .
 ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture:

 multiple Debian machines on the same network with a slower
 internet link.
 .
 The archive is automatically kept up to date using http,
 ftp or rsync.  Cache cleaning of unused and old versions
 is configurable.  You can also import the contents of
 your apt cache into the archive using apt-proxy-import.
 .
 For more information, see the apt-proxy homepage at

Description: Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.

Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, taper, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5,sha1,rmd160,tiger,haval,etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.

Description: digital audio workstation (graphical gtk interface)
 Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio
 workstation (DAW).
 .
 It can be used to control, record, edit and run and complex audio
 setups.  You can create advanced musical productions.
 .
 Ardour supports pro-audio interfaces through the ALSA project, which
 provides high quality, well design device drivers and API's for audio
 I/O under Linux. Any interface supported by ALSA can be used with
 Ardour.  This includes the all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the
 Midiman Delta 1010 and many others.
 .
 Ardour has support for 24 bit samples using foating point internally,
 non-linear editing with unlimited undo, a user-configurable mixer, MTC
 master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware control surface
 compatibility.
 .
 It supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC
 controller and many modern digital mixers.
 .
 Ardour contains a powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is
 completely non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear
 editing operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select,
 cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capacity and can
 save independent "versions" of a track or entire piece.
 .
 Ardour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA plugin
 standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any portion
 of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs and
 outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is included,
 with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader sends
 exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer strip
 acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is unlimited.
 You can submix any number of strips into another strip.
 .
 Ardour's channel capacity is limited only by the number on your audio
 interface and the ability of your disk subsystem to stream the data
 back and forth.
 .
 JACK (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) used for all audio I/O, permitting
 data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications
 and/or hardware audio interfaces.
 .
 Ardour is sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to
 32 bits, rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit
 IEEE oating point format.
 .

 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
 .
 Calc is built on top of the library libcalc that represents numeric values
 as fractions reduced to their lowest terms. This library can also be used
 to add arbitrary precision capabilities to your own programs and is
 available in the Debian package `apcalc-dev'.
 .
 The original name of this package is `calc', but it had to be changed to
 `apcalc' for Debian, because there's already another package called `calc'
 in Debian. Nevertheless, the binary and manpage installed by this package
 are still named `calc'.

 This program is based on the MSDOS ARC program, version 5.21, plus
 a few enhancements...
 .
  o ARC also performs Huffman Squeezing on data. The Huffman Squeeze
    algorithm was removed from MSDOS ARC after version 5.12. It turns
    out to be more efficient than Lempel-Ziv style compression when
    compressing graphic images. Squeeze analysis is always done now,
    and the best of packing, squeezing, or crunching is used.
 .
  o Compresses and extracts Squashed files. "Squashing" was created
    by Phil Katz in his PKxxx series of ARC utility programs for
    MSDOS. Dan Lanciani wrote the original modifications to ARC's
    Crunch code to handle Squashing. I've made minor changes since
    then, mostly to reduce the amount of memory required. The 'q'
    option flag must be specified to Squash files. The Squashing
    algorithm will be used instead of the usual Crunch algorithm,
    and will be compared against packing and squeezing, as before.

Description: tool to enable powersaving mode for Athlon/Duron processors
 athcool is a small utility for enabling/disabling Powersaving mode
 for AMD Athlon/Duron processors.
 .
 By enabling Powersaving mode you can lower power consumption and
 CPU temperature when the CPU is idle.
 .
 Powersaving works only if your kernel supports ACPI (APM does not
 work), because athcool does only (un)set the "Disconnect enable when
 STPGNT detected" bits in the Chipset's Northbridge. To really save
 power, the STPGNT signal has to be sent when the CPU is idling. This
 is done by the ACPI subsystem when C2 state entered.
 .
 !!!WARNING!!!
 Depending on your motherboard and/or hardware components, enabling
 Athlon powersaving mode sometimes causes:
 .
  * noisy or distorted sound playback,
  * a slowdown in harddisk performance,
  * system locks or instability,
  * massive corruption of the filesystem (observed at least once).
 .
 If you met those problems, you should not use athcool. Please use
 athcool AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 .
 If athcool works fine for you, and you want it to run automatically
 on startup, please read the /usr/share/doc/athcool/README.Debian
 file.

Description: KDE frontend for burning CDs
 Arson is a KDE frontend to various CD burning, and ripping tools. It
 supports burning audio, data, and video (VCD) through the use of a
 number of outside tools. Wav, Ogg Vorbis, MP3, SHN, and FLAC audio
 formats are supported, as are bin/cue and ISO-9660 CD images. Arson
 also supports writing CD-TEXT and auto-tagging of MP3s using ID3v2.
 .
 Note that Arson is merely a front-end. Separate programs, such as
 cdrecord or cdrdao for burning and cdda2wav or cdparanoia for ripping
 are required. Since various features of external programs are used
 for various tasks, you are strongly encouraged to also install all
 packages that arson Recommends. This will produce a reasonably full-
 featured install.
 .
 Because of patent issues, no MP3 encoders are currently available in
 Debian. It is recommended that you instead use the free Ogg Vorbis
 format for lossy encoding of audio data. If this does not suit your
 needs, you will need to provide a local copy of lame or bladeenc.
 SHN encoding and reading also requires external tools currently
 unavailable in Debian.

Description: 2d dogfight game in the tradition of 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'
 Airstrike is a 2d dogfight game in the tradition of the Intellivision and
 Amiga games 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'. It features a robust physics engine and
 several other extensions of the original games. It is currently 0-2 player
 only, but will hopefully have network play and some more advanced computer
 controlled enemies in the future. The graphics have been created using the
 Povray raytracer, and should be easy to extend and modify.

Description: an active DVI previewer and presenter
 Active-DVI is a DVI previewer and presenter written in Objective Caml
 with some eye candy effects for presentation, support for interactive
 demonstrations, and embedding of arbitrary applications within the
 presentation (hence the Active adjective of the presenter :).
 .
 Active-DVI does not (yet) support postscript fonts (see the README.Debian for
 more details).
 .
 Active-DVI also has the ability to run embedded commands, which may cause
 security problems when viewing untrusted DVI files. Make sure to read the
 README.Debian for more information.

Description: converter from ABC to MIDI format and back
 This package contains the programs `abc2midi' and `midi2abc',  which
 convert from the abc musical notation format to standard MIDI format
 and vice-versa. They can generate accompaniment from guitar chords
 in the abc file, as well as insert various MIDI events; the
 MIDI-to-abc translation tries to figure out bars, triplets and
 accidentals on its own.
 .
 The package also contains `abc2abc' (an abc prettyprinter/transposer),
 `mftext' (a program that dumps a MIDI file as text), and `midicopy'
 (a program that extracts specific tracks, channels or time intervals
 from a MIDI file).
 .
 The programs in this package are based on the `midifilelib'
 distribution available from http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/.
